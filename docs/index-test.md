While both of us are quite busy, we do __NOT__ believe in charging the exorbitant prices common in the East Bay. Our usual rate is $35 an hour for in-person sessions. We're flexible and willing to tutor at your house, over Zoom, or in a library. In certain circumstances, we even offer tutoring free of charge because we believe everyone has a right to an education. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any further questions.
